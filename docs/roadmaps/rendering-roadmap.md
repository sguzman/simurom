# Rendering roadmap (2D visuals)

## Purpose
Own 2D visual output: camera model, layering/z-order, sprites, shapes, materials, viewport scaling, and optional offscreen rendering.

## Non-goals
- Timeline/tweening logic (belongs to `animation-roadmap.md`).
- Simulation (belongs to `simulation-roadmap.md`).

## Dependencies
- `runtime-roadmap.md` (scene instantiation hooks)
- `assets-roadmap.md` (textures/fonts)

## Milestones

### M0 — basic 2D render primitives from TOML
- [x] Spawn sprites with explicit z-order/layering semantics
- [x] Spawn basic shapes (rect, circle, polygon) with color and size
- [x] Add background clear color and/or background quad policy
- [x] Add camera config: position, zoom, clear color

### M1 — layout + scaling correctness
- [x] Define coordinate system policy (pixels vs world units) and implement it consistently
- [x] Add viewport scaling modes (fit, fill, pixel-perfect) configurable
- [x] Add anchor/origin semantics for sprites/shapes/text and test them with fixtures
- [x] Add scene resolution policy (scene override or global config) and apply it to the window

### M2 — materials and effects
- [x] Add sprite tint/opacity controls
- [x] Add simple shader/material hooks (optional; feature-gated)
- [x] Add layered post-processing pipeline hooks (optional; future-ready)

## Effect integration
- [x] Define TOML-facing effect binding model (per-entity and/or global passes)
- [x] Add WGSL effect material example (minimal) and ensure it loads from TOML refs

### M3 — offscreen rendering and capture
- [x] Add render-to-texture support for compositing
- [x] Add screenshot capture API

## Grouped tasks

### Deterministic draw ordering
- [x] Define stable sorting key for renderables (layer, z, entity_id tie-break)
- [x] Add tests verifying ordering is deterministic given the same scene input
